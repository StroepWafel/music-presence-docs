This URL is then sent to Discord to be used in the status as the large image.   This process is instant and has no extra delays.</li> <li>As soon as Discord sends a request to that URL,   in order to display the image in the status,   the Proxy server will forward that request to the Music Presence application.   Once Music Presence receives that forwarded request,   it will respond by sending the image information   back to Discord through the Proxy server.   The image is cropped to a 100x100 center square before being sent.   This amounts to about 20-30 KB in most cases,   which should be handled just fine be any decent internet connection.</li> <li>The Proxy server stores the image   for a very short duration (less than a minute)   and is discarded after that duration.   No image data is stored permanently.   The server is only used as an intermediary to send the image to Discord,   as Discord does not provide any mechanism to upload images for your status.</li> <li>Once you stop listening to music   or when the server connection is not needed anymore,   Music Presence disconnects from the Proxy server.</li> </ul> <p>Since this feature implements a \"Proxy\", it is theoretically possible that Music Presence users are spammed with forwarded requests from the Proxy server, if a malicious actor gets hold of one or more generated URLs.</p> <p>A number of techniques are employed to prevent this from happening:</p> <ul> <li>The application only responds to forwarded requests   which come from URLs that were actually generated by Music Presence.   If Music Presence never generates a URL, then it never gets any request.</li> <li>The response for a request to a generated URL is cached on the server   for a short duration (30 seconds at the time of writing).   This ensures that the application can get at most   one forwarded request for that duration   and cannot be spammed with requests for a single generated URL.</li> <li>Due to the way the system was designed,   old generated URLs cannot be revoked and will be forwarded to Music Presence,   even when they are not in use anymore.   In those cases Music Presence will respond with empty content   and not upload any data.   A malicious actor could collect these URLs and request them all at once.   To prevent serving too many old URLs,   if too many are requested within a given time frame,   the connection is simply closed and restarted.   Closing the connection revokes any generated URLs.   This should not happen in practice,   but it is being handled, just in case.</li> </ul>","path":["Features","Cover images from media players"],"tags":[]},{"location":"cover-images-proxy/#source-code","level":2,"title":"Source code","text":"<p>The logic behind this is rather complex and has been decoupled from Music Presence in its own server and library:</p> <ul> <li>ungive/loon  - local files online   loon enables you to temporarily host a local file online via HTTP, without exposing your device to the internet, by using the bare minimum of resources needed. https://github.com/ungive/loon</li> </ul> <p>Last updated: 27.08.2024</p>","path":["Features","Cover images from media players"],"tags":[]},{"location":"installation-instructions/","level":1,"title":"How to install and use Music Presence","text":"<p>To install Music Presence, pick the right download for your platform:</p> <p> </p> <p>Don't know what download to choose?

It also outlines that doing this not only makes Music Presence detect the media player, but also offers the users of the media player a better user experience:</p> <p>For your media player to be detected by Music Presence, it needs to report what media it is playing to the operating system. On Windows this would e.g. be done via SMTC (System Media Transport Controls), which is the Windows API that pretty much every media player or application uses to offer playback information and media controls to the user through Windows's native controls: https://imgur.com/a/YDQegwW Implementing this would not only make your media player work with Music Presence, but also offer every user of your player a better user experience and proper integration with the operating system, which ultimately improves the quality of your media player as a whole. Your media player should report at least this information to work flawlessly with Music Presence: Playback status (playing or paused), song title, artist, album name, live playback position, song duration and the album cover image. Official Windows Documentation for SMTC: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.systemmediatransportcontrols On Mac devices the \"MediaRemote\" framework is used by Music Presence to detect media from applications, on Linux your media player should use MPRIS to report what it is playing. These are standard protocols/APIs which are widely used for the purpose of reporting what media an application is playing.</p> <p>You can quote me on this in case you open a feature request with a media player.</p> <p>Good luck!</p>","path":["Community","Support request template"],"tags":[]},{"location":"supported-media-players/","level":1,"title":"Supported media players","text":"<p>[!WARNING] This page is not kept up to date.

When in doubt though, favour accuracy of the translation over limiting its length!

The text inbetween the braces and/or the translation note describes what each of these placeholders will contain, e.g. <code>{player_name}</code> will contain the name of a media player. An example of a translation might be <code>Settings for {player_name}</code> which is translated to <code>Einstellungen für {player_name}</code> for German.
